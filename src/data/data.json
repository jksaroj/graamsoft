'Soft' has been coined from 'Software,' the core of our services.",
    "paragraph_2": "At GraamSoft, we code for a cause. The more we are driving towards automation, people are getting left behind– and that’s not because of lack of talent, but lack of access. While businesses struggle with delayed IT processes, the rural youth suffers from lack of exposure and training. With an aim to hit both these targets, GraamSoft was born out of the belief that intelligent software can—and should—create equally intelligent opportunities for all.",
